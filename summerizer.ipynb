      "Rishi Sunak is proposing to stop asylum seekers who cross the Channel in small boats from appealing against their deportation, according to reports. The Home Office, led by Suella Braverman, had put forward two options for the prime minister’s consideration as he attempts to automatically prevent those arriving in Britain from claiming asylum, the Times reported. It is understood one proposal would be to withdraw people’s right to appeal against their automatic exclusion from the asylum system. Under the other scheme, people arriving on small boats would only be allowed to lodge an appeal after they had already been deported. Under the current law, all asylum seekers have the right to remain in Britain to have their cases heard but Sunak has vowed in recent weeks to “stop the boats”.\n"

      "Summary for https://lawandspace.com/negotiating-their-future-a-marshallese-geography-of-us-policy/: The article discusses the complex history of the United States' relationship with the Marshall Islands, and the various policies that have governed Marshallese mobility. It describes how the Compact of Free Association has allowed Marshallese citizens to live and work in the US as legal residents, but notes that they have often faced challenges in accessing healthcare, education, housing, and employment. The article argues that the Marshallese have developed a unique \"geography of policy\" in response to these challenges.\n",

      "Summary for https://immigrationimpact.com/2023/02/08/awaiting-court-dates-notice-to-appear/: The article discusses a new report from NBC News that indicates nearly 600,000 migrants who have crossed into the United States since March 2021 have not been given a \"Notice to Appear\" (NTA), which formally begins the immigration court process. This has left them without court dates, which could make it harder for them to navigate the complicated asylum process. The article points out that the NBC report leaves out important context as to why releases occurred in the first place, namely that the releases were implemented in an attempt to protect children from some of the horrors they faced while detained in CBP facilities under the Trump administration.\n",

The policy is being considered as a way to deter people from making the dangerous crossing, but critics argue that it could violate international law and put people's lives at risk.\n",
