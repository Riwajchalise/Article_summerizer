The report leaves out important context as to why releases occurred in the first place. The NBC report analyzed data on “family units” (parents arriving with their children) released at the border through two U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) policies started in 2021. These policies were implemented in an attempt to protect children from some of the horrors they faced while detained in CBP facilities under the Trump administration.\n",

The Home Office had put forward two options for the prime minister’s consideration as he attempts to automatically prevent those arriving in Britain from claiming asylum. It is understood one proposal would be to withdraw people’s right to appeal against their automatic exclusion from the asylum system. Under the other scheme, people arriving on small boats would only be allowed to lodge an appeal after they had already been deported.\n",
